## Overview

### Introduction

Klotski is a traditional Chinese puzzle game in which players need to move the "Cao Cao" block out of the board's exit. The game is typically played on a rectangular board with blocks of different sizes and shapes. In this project, we suppose the exit, the size of game panel and each block's size and number are fixed.

## Q & A

- *Q: After a guest enters the game, the username will be displayed as `Guest`. Will this cause any conflict with users whose usernames are also `Guest`?*
- ✅ No. If the user is also named `Guest`, their information will be stored in the `User` section, where the `isGuest` value is `false`, and their username and password will also be stored in `user.config`. Therefore, the game will be able to recognize the user, and all functions such as saving and loading the game can operate normally.

- *Q: When choosing levels, what if all the map resources have been destroyed?*
- ✅ At each level, one map resource is randomly selected from three options. If the map we choose do not have the size of $4*5$, we will load the default map, and users can play the game normally.

- 💡 In the `saveGame` method, the saved path is `data/username/data.txt`, and its format is: 
```
[level]
[steps]
[used time]
[best steps]
[best time]
[map data (4*5)]
```

- 💡 In the `loadGame` method, the errors we can detect are:
    * `level` string is not `Easy`, `Medium` or `Hard`;
    * Time has been used up;
    * The size of map data is not $4*5$;
    * Missing or extra lines.

- 💡 The `Undo` and `Restart` functions after using the hammer and obstacle tools:
    * After performing `Restart`, all the deleted soldiers and the designated restricted areas will be restored;
    * The operations using the tools are irreversible. Therefore, if the soldiers deleted by the `Undo` operation have already been removed, the `Undo` operation will not be executed and an error message will be displayed;
    * Similarly, if the original position has been set as a restricted area, the `Undo` operation will not be executed either, and an error message will be displayed.
